# Core-Java-Assignment-2-Set-B

In this I created  a Parent class Shape. 
1.      Made Rectangle, Triangle and Square as the subclasses. 
        Make calculateArea method as a base method in Shape class. 

2.      Override the conversion method in all the other classes (Rectangle, Triangle and Square).

3.      Made parameterized constructor in individual derived subclasses which takes calculation parameters (like length, breadth, height etc.)
        as parameters and does the area calculation.

4.      Made another class “calculateArea” with overloaded parameterized constructors. 
        These parameterized constructors take shapeType and other parameters as length, breadth etc. and calculates the Area.

-   Made use of Access Specifiers in the above program:

            Made the calculateArea method private in the parent class.

            Made the overridden methods public in the subclasses.
